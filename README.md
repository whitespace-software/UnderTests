# UnderTests
API Testing in Node using Cucumber-JS

## Setup
- Follow https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-windows 
- which points to https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows
- which points to https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
- which downloads https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download/1.1.7/nvm-setup.zip
- but I had to use https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/issues/41 to fix nvm\settings.txt
